          Greetings. My name is Taoyuan Zhang. Or you can call me Tom. I was borned in Shang Hai, China. I came to the US when I was 6 years old. I was one of those people who got into computers much later than my peers. Back then in High School, some of my peers would sometimes discuss computer topics while I would sit on the sidelines completely mystified. I was also somewhat scared of getting involved with computer stuff. Of course, I did eventually get hooked on using the computer and later found some of the subject very interesting and fun to learn. I remember visiting my first MMO site and getting completely hooked on how such artistic pages were made. I had alot of fun browser different site back then. About 3 years ago, an old friend of mine from back in High School said the designing the website can be fun too depending on the situation. I had no idea what he meant but that line did bring me to this class.

      <div id="article">
        <h3>The PROS</h3>
        <p>
          The iframe tag can be used to embed a map locations from Google map. This can come in handy if your website needs to address a certain location to its viewer. For example, you're in charge of making a page to advertise a band concert happening at RVCC (or any location for that matter). You want to make sure everyone who visited your website knows where RVCC is. Embedding a google map to your site is very useful in that case. Iframe is an easy method to displaying another webpage on your own webpage.
        </p>

        <h3>The CONS</h3>
        <p>
          Keep in mind that since you are embedding content from a different onto yours, you are using content that not your own, so it is important that you ask for permission before using someone else's contents. Also, iframe comes with several downsides. Here are a few to list:
        </p>

        <h4>Slow down your page's loading time:</h4>
        <p>
          A page that uses iframe is loading the borrowed webpage as well as itself at the same time thus increasing loading time.
        </p>

        <h4>Bad for search engine optimization:</h4>
        <p>
          Search engines, like google, uses keywords to find website. Since whatever that's display inside an iframe isn't yours, that chunk of space where the iframe is displayed doesn't contribute to putting your page on the top of any search engine finds.
